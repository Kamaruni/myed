# MyEd

A clone of [ed](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ed) written in Ruby. 
Created during [Codefreeze 2025](https://codefreeze.fi) as a multi-day exercise. 
We wrote all of the code in `ed`, up until the commit tagged as `start_dogfooding`. 
From then on, we used our own implementation to write all the code.
